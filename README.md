- ðŸ‘‹ Hello world
- I'm Adam Davies, an entrepreneur and technical consultant. Most of my projects are private but can show some when requested. My current project is an AI machine learning day trading application where I have built out a fullstack application
from the backends (node.js, Flask) to React, with Tensorflow and various data science libraries for the analysis of candlestick data.

I am teaching myself machine learning analysis with Python from the book below and other scientific journals found online.
